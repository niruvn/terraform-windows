# Terraform vSphere WindowsVM example

For Virtual Machine Provisioning with Windows customization.

> Note: For module to work it needs number of required variables corresponding to an existing resources in vSphere. Please refer to variable section for the list of required variables.

## Usage

Following example contains the bare minimum options to be configured for the Windows VM deployment.

### Example of basic Windows VM

```hcl
module "example-server-windowsvm-withdatadisk" {
  source            = "Terraform-VMWare-Modules/vm3nic/vsphere"
  version           = "0.1.0"
  vmtemp            = "TemplateName"
  instances         = 1
  vmname            = "example-server-windows"
  vmrp              = "esxi/Resources"  
  net01              = "Name of the VLAN in vSphere for the first NIC"
  net02              = "Name of the VLAN in vSphere for the Second NIC"
  net03              = "Name of the VLAN in vSphere for the Third NIC"
  is_windows_image  = "true"
  dc                = "Datacenter"
  ds_cluster        = "Data Store Cluster name"
  winadminpass      = "Str0ngP@ssw0rd!" //Optional
}
```

### Example of Windows VM with additional

```hcl
module "example-server-windowsvm-withdatadisk" {
  source            = "Terraform-VMWare-Modules/vm3nic/vsphere"
  version           = "0.1.0"
  vmtemp            = "TemplateName"
  instances         = 1
  vmname            = "example-server-windows"
  vmrp              = "esxi/Resources"  
  net01              = "Name of the VLAN in vSphere for the first NIC"
  net02              = "Name of the VLAN in vSphere for the Second NIC"
  net03              = "Name of the VLAN in vSphere for the Third NIC"
  data_disk         = "true"
  data_disk_size_gb = 20
  is_windows_image  = "true"
  dc                = "Datacenter"
  ds_cluster        = "Data Store Cluster name"
  winadminpass      = "Str0ngP@ssw0rd!"
}
```

### Example of Windows VM joined to Domain!

```hcl
module "example-server-windowsvm-withdatadisk-domain" {
  source            = "Terraform-VMWare-Modules/vm/vsphere"
  version           = "0.9.2"
  vmtemp            = "TemplateName"
  instances         = 1
  vmname            = "example-server-windows"
  vmrp              = "esxi/Resources"  
  vlan              = "Name of the VLAN in vSphere"
  is_windows_image  = "true"
  join_windomain    = "true"
  domainpass        = "Domain Password"
  domainuser        = "Domain User"
  run_once          = ["echo Hello World"]
  productkey        = "WC2BQ-8NRM3-FDDYY-2BFGV-KHKQY"
  dc                = "Datacenter"
  ds_cluster        = "Data Store Cluster name"
  ipaddress         = ["10.0.0.13"]
  vmdns             = ["1.1.1.1", "8.8.8.8"]
  vmgateway         = "10.0.0.1"
  winadminpass      = "Str0ngP@ssw0rd!"
}
```

### Example of Windows VM joined to Domain and with additional data disk

```hcl
module "example-server-windowsvm-withdatadisk-domain" {
  source            = "Terraform-VMWare-Modules/vm/vsphere"
  version           = "0.9.2"
  vmtemp            = "TemplateName"
  instances         = 1
  vmname            = "example-server-windows"
  vmrp              = "esxi/Resources"  
  vlan              = "Name of the VLAN in vSphere"
  is_windows_image  = "true"
  data_disk         = "true"
  data_disk_size_gb = 40
  join_windomain    = "true"
  domainpass        = "Domain Password"
  domainuser        = "Domain User"
  run_once          = ["echo Hello World"]
  productkey        = "WC2BQ-8NRM3-FDDYY-2BFGV-KHKQY"
  dc                = "Datacenter"
  ds_cluster        = "Data Store Cluster name"
  ipaddress         = ["10.0.0.13"]
  vmdns             = ["1.1.1.1", "8.8.8.8"]
  vmgateway         = "10.0.0.1"
  winadminpass      = "Str0ngP@ssw0rd!"
}
```
